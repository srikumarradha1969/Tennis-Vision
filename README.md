**About the Tennis Vision Project**

The detection of white colored Tennis Court lines, has been done in most of the Tennis related Apps for coaching or training etc. In addition, the typical features of such Tennis Apps would also include Tennis Ball traching, Players detection. More areas of potential interest would include tennis serve speed measurement, and also,a Hawk-Eye kind of facility to determine if the ball is in or out either during a Serve or Rally.
